Within the `comp1110.homework.J06` package of the `comp1110-homework` project,
create a class `Prime` that reads a positive integer `n` from the console and
then prints all of the prime numbers that are less than or equal to `n`, one on each line.
Note: the smallest prime number is 2.
Test your solution using the `J06` test.

Once you have it working, add and commit your work.
